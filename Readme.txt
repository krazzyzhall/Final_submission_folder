for running the the code run final in matlab shell

>> final 

this will cluster all the 4 datasets and can cluster them too.

this will generate a few important graphs for the datasets.

there are other files that like DBSCAN and Distance spikesort which need to be in the 
same folder as final.m as it uses these function. 
 for the code to run correctly we need 
Sampledata_1.mat
Sampledata_2.mat
Sampledata_3.mat
Sampledata_4.mat
Sampledata_test_1.mat
Sampledata_test_2.mat
Sampledata_test_3.mat
Sampledata_test_4.mat

there is a variable called used_data which can be either set to 'testing' or 'training'
to select training data or test data respectively
